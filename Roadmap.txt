This program NEEDS to:
    Simulate:
	- 30 hosts
	- 4 busses
	*Over:
	    - 1000 Time intervals
	    - 100 Itterations
    Printout:
	- Itteration Probability
	*Per-Itteration:
	    - Sucessessfull Sends Per Buss
	    - Collisions Per Buss
	    - Total Successful Sends
	    - Total Collisions

Phase 1 - Base Functions

NOT doing object oriented coding due to wasted overhead and simplicity of the code

    * Host (Computer) ()
X	- Constructor Requires: 
	    Probability (0-100)
	    Number of busses
X	- Accepts:
	    NONE
X	- Returns:
	    Bus packet sent on (-1 if no packet sent)
X	- Action
	    Based on probability, decides if a packet is sent
	    Determines what bus packet is sent on (even chance for each bus)
	    Return bus # if sent, -1 if not sent

    * summaryWriter class (int, int[][], file OUTPUT)
	- Accepts: 
	    2 int's, 1 file
	    { PROBABILITY, RAWDATA, OUTPUTFILE}
	- Returns:
	    NONE
	- Actions:
	    Writes out data as shown in Phase 4.1
		X	COLISSIONS  EMPTY_SLOTS GOOD_SENDS 1 Used 2 Used 3 Used 4 Used
	    PROBABILITY	    #		#	    #	    #	    #	    #	  #
	    \n

Phase 2 - Main program skeleton
    - Construct Host (use static p=.5, b=4 for testing)
	Output to stdOut for debugging
    - Pass summaryWriter some test data to write
    - Close File
    - Destruct classes

Phase 2.1 - Host loop
    - Loop through host calls 5 times (to test)

Phase 3 - Time loop
    - Add Time loop around Host loop
	Loop through 25 time increments

Phase 3.1 - Colision and Open Bus detection
    - Keep track of used busses
	Mark colision if two hosts try to send on same bus
	Mark open if bus is un-used in the time loop

Phase 4 - Write out summary data at end of time loop
    - Keep track of collissions and empty slots in loop
    - Keep track of 1/4 .. 4/4 utilization of busses
    - Write out summary data at completion of time loop
    - Zero out variables

Phase 5 - Add probability loop
    - Add loop before creation of hosts for probability incrementing
    - Increment 0 to 1 by 0.1

Phase 6 - Full Time
    - Increase time increment limit to 1000

Phase 6.1 - Full Probability
    - Change probability increment from 0.1 to 0.01
